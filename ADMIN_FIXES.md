# âœ… Admin Panel Issues Fixed!

## Problems Resolved:

### 1. **Contact Info "[object Object]" Issue** âœ…

**Problem**: Contacts were displaying as "[object Object]" because the API returns an array of contact objects, but the UI expected a simple key-value object.

**Solution**:

- Updated contacts section to handle array of contact objects
- Added proper form fields for: Type, Label, Value, Active status
- Added ability to add/remove contact methods
- Connected save functionality to API

### 2. **Services Section Broken** âœ…

**Problem**: Services were not displaying correctly because the API returns service objects with properties like `name`, `description`, `category`, etc., but the UI expected just an array of strings.

**Solution**:

- Updated services section to handle full service objects
- Added form fields for: Name, Category, Duration, Price, Description, Active status
- Added ability to add/remove services
- Connected save functionality to API
